# MarksheetLedgerBlockchain

## Problem Statement

1. When you apply for any abroad university, you know how much efforts it take to get all of your marksheets in place. You need to ask college for transcripts, go to that certification site to download the marksheet and what not !!!
2. Marksheet is just a peice of paper, so anyone creative enough can create a good enough replica and forge it. If you know Suits webseries you know this problem ;).
3. For sure you have mispaced atleast one of the marksheets. And once you do that, you know the FIRs you have to do, visiting university multiple times and paying 1000s of rupees to get the copy of the marksheet.

# Solution

1. We store marksheet over CELOS blockchain in such a way that an university can fetch all the academic details of the students just by entering his universal roll number.
2. Marksheets can be entered in ledger only by the organization nodes so forging or tampering marksheets is out of equation. No more Mike Ross stuff ;)
3. Now there is no way you are ever going to lose any marksheet, even if you want to forget the time you failed so bad !!!

## Introduction:

We introduce a marksheet ledger stored over blockchain celos. Every student in the world will have a unique studentID (similar to SSN number). Every academic marksheet of student has to be stored over the blockchain. Colleges are responsible in storing marksheet over blockchain. When student applies to any college (abroad or domestic) he will just have to share his studentID and his target college will get all the details of this student.

## Motivation

Motivation uhhh! There is an entire sad story for us to make this project. My friend was applying for foreign studies. One such college had a hard deadline for which he had to submit his marksheets within 7 days. He asked the college for transcripts and as ususal the college replied very late with the necessary documents. He missed the deadline, sad :( But we decided that day, that no other student should face this and hence this system is made. Second motivation is Mike Ross, of course I'm a suits fan!. No more Mike Ross in the society to create chaos

## Approach

1. Student is give a unique studentID
2. Organization buy their way into system by hosting few tens of nodes
3. Organization creates marksheet for their students using studentID
4. Those marksheets stay in ledger for eternity
5. Student can provide his studentID to any organization he wants to apply to. No more need of maintaining offline records.

We take advantage of this features in the data points to train the machine learning model.


# Scalability and Useability

This model is based on organizations paying the cost for maintainance of blockchain. All organizations will be pushed to use this system and students enrolling them would demand this system and it would make everyones life easy. To be a part of this system, organizations will have to maintain tens of nodes and hence more the organizations, stronger the blockchain. Every organization will start recommending this system as it would easen and automate the student application review process. So this system is scalable and maintainable.
